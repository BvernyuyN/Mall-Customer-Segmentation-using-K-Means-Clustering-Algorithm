# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm

## Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation on a Mall customer dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset provides information about customers, including age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The primary objective is to cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.

## Methodology
Utilizing the K-Means clustering technique, the data is partitioned into various subgroups based on distinct features. This segmentation allows the mall management to concentrate efforts on specific clusters with average spending scores, aiming to maximize overall profitability.


## Tools Used 

-K-means clustering

-Elbow method

-Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn,mplot3d

## Dataset
The dataset [mall-customers-data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) consists of 200 rows and 5 columns:

1. **customer_id:** Unique ID assigned to the customer.
2. **gender:** Gender of the customer (male or female).
3. **age:** Age of the customer.
4. **annual_income:** Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
5. **spending_score:** Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

## Conclusion
This project's outcomes empower the mall management with actionable insights for strategic decision-making. The clustering results facilitate a targeted approach towards customer segments, fostering customer satisfaction and optimizing business performance.
